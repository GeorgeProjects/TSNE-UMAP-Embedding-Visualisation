# TSNE-Embedding-Visualisation
A Simple and easy to use way to Visualise Embeddings!

### What this project is? 
This project is forked from [Tensorflow's Standalone Embedding Projector](https://github.com/tensorflow/embedding-projector-standalone).
It shows how a pretrained InceptionV3 model can be used on images and plotted in an interactive 3d map.


### Why this over the Standalone Projector? 
This project allows you to visualise any array of vectors with a light depency stack. It is designed to be decoupled form any library. Moreover , it uses a static file system, so you can publish your results without requiring a server. E.g. https://harveyslash.github.io/TSNE-Embedding-Visualisation/.
